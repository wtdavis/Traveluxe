Welcome to Traveluxe! This represents a collaboration between Malcolm Caleb (Raleigh, NC) and Will Davis (NYC, NY).

Some people think travel requires bravery; airlines, unfortunately, insist that travel also requires cash. Our dynamic global heatmap will, in three dimensions, display \
trends in global travel prices, mapping the most expensive destinations and the cheapest, the most popular and most vacant, and will uncover the best value for any traveller,\
whether they seek to follow the crowd or avoid it, to lavish or to thrift.
